Welcome to MCNP Tools — your unified environment for running and analysing MCNP simulations.

========================
Running Simulations
========================
1. Select Folder or Single File
• Use the 'Browse' button to choose your MCNP input folder.
• Choose between running all files in the folder or a single file.

2. Configure Settings
• Set the number of parallel jobs (simulations that can run at once).
• MCNP input files must end in .inp or have no extension.

3. Run Simulations
• Click 'Run Simulations' to start.
• The interface will show estimated completion time, progress, countdown, and live queue status.
• If output files already exist (e.g. o or r), you’ll be prompted to delete, back up, or cancel.

========================
Analysing Results
========================
1. Select Neutron Sources
• Tick boxes for neutron sources in your setup:
  – Small tank (1.25e6 n/s)
  – Big tank (2.5e6 n/s)
  – Graphite stack (7.5e6 n/s)

2. Choose Analysis Type
• Options:
  – Efficiency & Neutron Rates (single output file)
  – Thickness Comparison (simulation vs experiment)
  – Source Position Alignment (displacement scan)
  – Photon Tally Plot (gamma tally from single file)
  – Multi Thickness Comparison (multiple simulation folders)

3. Run the Analysis
• Click 'Run Analysis' to begin.
• Saved plots will appear below and in the 'plots' folder.

File Naming Tips:
• Thickness Comparison: use endings like '_10cmo', '_5cmo', or the shorter '_10o'.
• Source Alignment: use displacement-style names like '5_0cm'.

========================
CSV Output (if enabled)
========================
• CSVs will save in a separate 'csvs' folder.
• Type 1: neutron & photon tallies + summary.
• Type 2: simulated vs experimental data.
• Type 3: displacement vs detected rate.
• Type 4: photon tally energy spectrum.
• Type 5: multi-thickness comparison data.

========================
Configuration
========================
MCNP Tools looks for the base directory of your MCNP installation when
constructing paths. You can specify this location by setting the
``MCNP_BASE_DIR`` or ``MY_MCNP`` environment variable or by creating a
``~/.mcnp_tools_settings.json`` file with a ``"MY_MCNP_PATH"`` entry. If
neither is provided, your home directory is used by default.
